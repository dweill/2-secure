# After Action Report

Mission Accomplished!

## Components Added

- logout-form (Logout form is a bit of a misnomer at this point. It's more accurately a logout page).

## Plan Vs Execution

I was able to do everything I had set out to do in my previous log. I ended up going with the approach of checking every character for authorization every time. When you type fast, it creates a hilarious effect where the overlays stack on top of each other and make the background very black. It gets lighter as you enter your username and password more times.

Logout functionality works beautifully. And my pranks work perfectly.

I call this an absolute win!
